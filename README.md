# Project Specifications
A Todo webapp  where the user can list projects and list down tasks associated with that project
Every task has a title, description, due date and priority

# Project Post-mortem
This was the toughest project in the course so far, which mirrors with a lot of what other students said.
It took me three weeks of on-and-off work
The concepts of using Model - View - Controller thinking in the implementation helped a lot in structuring the code
There are things I could still improve but overall I'm happy with how this turned out
